# What is this Repo for? ü§î

This repository was a playground for me during my initial phase of learning front-end development with React. I used it to explore the use of APIs from the front-end, discovering how to connect and interact with various services.

Eventually, I mastered these concepts and more, concurrently developing another, more significant project in my portfolio: [BuddyFightersNft](https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/BuddyFighters-FullstackWeb3NFTGame). This experience laid the foundation for crafting a complex (state-wise) Single Page Application (SPA) using React.

# FTA (Fair-Taxes-Analytics) üí∞

## (IN DEVELOPMENT)

FTA is a SPA created using React. It's designed to provide users with a tool to analyze the percentage of government spending and how it translates to costs for individuals across various taxation levels.

By including API calls to fetch official government data, it ensures an accurate and reliable analysis, offering insights into the financial implications of different fiscal policies.
